# MIDI Injection Running Notes

Purpose: append-only notes for debugging `midi_to_move` injection stability in `src/move_anything_shim.c`.

## 2026-03-10

### Evidence observed
- Crash window showed mailbox occupancy spikes (`occ=3..5`, including slot 4) while injector activity continued.
- Crashes included assertion signal for event ordering and an additional assertion in `EventBuffer.hpp:233` (out-of-range event times).
- In external-injection mode, injector busy/interleave conditions were still causing queue drops.

### Change implemented
- External busy guard now blocks injection whenever the contiguous prefix is non-empty (`search_start > 0`), not only when 2+ slots are occupied.
- Busy return (`insert_rc == 2`) now defers queue processing to next cycle (keeps packet queued) instead of dequeueing/dropping.

### Tests
- Updated `tests/shadow/test_midi_to_move_injection_stability.sh` to assert:
  - guard condition is `search_start > 0`
  - busy path breaks/defer-retries
  - busy path does not advance `read_idx`
- Test result: PASS.

### Commit and deploy
- Commit: `835f51d` (`shim: defer midi injection when external mode sees busy prefix`)
- Branch pushed: `origin/MidiInTesting`
- Build/deploy artifact MD5: `5014374e4aaaa56066d3b2e5b6366dbd`
- Installed with: `./scripts/install.sh local --skip-confirmation --skip-modules`

## 2026-03-10 (internal mode parity)

### Evidence observed
- `midi_inject_test` was stable in external mode after busy-prefix defer changes.
- Crash could still occur in `source_mode=internal` (example repro: arp running while pads held).
- Root cause: strongest shim guard checks were keyed to external mode only.

### Change implemented
- Added queue mode flag: `SHADOW_MIDI_TO_MOVE_MODE_INTERNAL` in shared-memory header.
- `midi_inject_test` now publishes both external and internal mode flags based on current `source_mode`.
- Shim guard activation now uses a combined guard predicate (external OR internal mode enabled), so:
  - non-empty-prefix busy guard applies to internal mode
  - mailbox duplicate suppression applies to internal mode
  - internal-aftertouch suppression gate is enabled for guarded internal-forwarding windows

### Verification
- `tests/shadow/test_midi_to_move_injection_stability.sh`: PASS (updated to assert internal-flag plumbing + internal guard activation)
- Full build: PASS (`./scripts/build.sh`)

## 2026-03-10 (internal-mode dropout investigation)

### Evidence observed
- In `source_mode=internal`, users observed playback stopping after ~1-2s while arp/held notes were active.
- Shim diagnostics during repro showed healthy injector behavior (`inj` events present, `full=0`, `busy_drop=0`, no assertion spikes in sampled window).
- `midi_inject_test.log` showed repeated `drop reason=source src=2 mode=internal` (including note status), indicating source-filter mismatch upstream.

### Root cause
- Chain v1 path applies source gating via input mode before forwarding to synth.
- Chain v2 path (`v2_on_midi`) did not apply equivalent per-instance source gating before MIDI FX processing.
- Result: feedback/external-tagged events could still perturb arp/held-note state in internal-mode workflows.

### Change implemented
- Added per-instance source-gate helper in chain v2 path:
  - allow `MOVE_MIDI_SOURCE_HOST`
  - enforce `MIDI_INPUT_PADS` => internal only
  - enforce `MIDI_INPUT_EXTERNAL` => external only
- Applied gate in `v2_on_midi` before MIDI FX processing.

### Verification
- Added host regression test: `tests/host/test_chain_v2_midi_source_gate.sh` (PASS)
- Existing guard test: `tests/shadow/test_midi_to_move_injection_stability.sh` (PASS)

## 2026-03-10 (internal-mode dropout with external MIDI connected)

### Evidence observed
- Dropout still reproduced in `source_mode=internal` when an external MIDI device was connected.
- Active slot config had chain `input: "both"` with `midi_inject_test` synth + `superarp` MIDI FX.
- `midi_inject_test` logs showed `drop reason=source src=2 mode=internal`, while shim injector stayed healthy (`full=0`, `busy_drop=0`), indicating no queue starvation.

### Hypothesis
- External-source events were still entering chain MIDI FX (including `superarp`) before synth-level source filtering in `midi_inject_test`.
- That let feedback/external stream perturb arp held-note state; once held set was cleared, output stopped even with pads held.

### Change implemented
- Added `inst_midi_inject_test_source_allowed(...)` in chain v2 path.
- For synth module `midi_inject_test`, read synth `source_mode` and gate by source *before* MIDI FX processing:
  - `internal` => accept only `MOVE_MIDI_SOURCE_INTERNAL`
  - `external` => accept only `MOVE_MIDI_SOURCE_EXTERNAL`
  - keep host-generated source allowed
- Applied guard in `v2_on_midi` immediately after per-instance input gate.

### Verification
- Extended `tests/host/test_chain_v2_midi_source_gate.sh` to assert:
  - new pre-MIDI-FX gate call is present
  - helper checks `midi_inject_test` module + synth `source_mode`
  - internal/external source rules are enforced
